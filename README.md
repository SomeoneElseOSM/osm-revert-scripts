The scripts in this directory together form the "osmtools" suite.

Originally written by Frederik Ramm <frederik@remote.org>, public domain.

The scripts require Perl and the LWP module.  On Ubuntu, that would be:
sudo apt install libwww-perl libfile-homedir-perl libterm-readkey-perl libbytes-random-secure-perly

Design "Philosophy"
-------------------

Most functionality is implemented as individual Perl modules (.pm). They do not have a namespace because we want people to be able to run everything from the current directory. If you create a Perl module named "Osm::Api", then it has to reside in a subdirectory named "Osm" which tends to get confusing, at least for me.

We're not using any libraries for XML reading and writing, just plain regular expressions.

We're not creating any OO interfaces.

In addition to the modules, there are simple perl scripts (.pl) that can be called from the command line and that provide a command line interface to what the modules do.

If you want to create some hyper cool object oriented undo/redo manager using all the latest libraries and technologies and design patterns, feel free to cannibalize the hell out of this code and make your own.

Act Responsibly
---------------

These scripts enable you to revert edits done by other people. Never do this unless you are absolutely sure that the edit in question is either malicious or accidental. Make an effort to talk to the user beforehand and afterwards. Always be kind to other mappers, and always assume that if they did something wrong it must have been an error, a misunderstanding, or their cat chasing fluff across the keyboard!

When in doubt, discuss things on the mailing list before you act (see lists.openstreetmap.org). Also, [read the Wiki article on automated edits here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automated_Edits).

These scripts do not have safety nets. Be sure that you feel confident to fix anything you might break. If you do not know your PUTs from your GETs, if you do not know the details of API 0.6, or know what changesets are and how they work, then DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE.

Configuration
-------------

You will have to create a file named .osmtoolsrc in your home directory containing the URL of the OSM server to use. If the server is neither the main or the sandbox OSM server, you may need to add the oauth2 client id if you want to use oauth2. This requires registering osmtools as a oauth2 app on the server, see the section below. Alternatively you may use basic authorization; in this case you have to provide your username and password. Some operation require username and password anyway, see the "SCRAPE" section below.

The server URL must be complete up to the API version number and the slash afterwards, so:

    apiurl=https://api06.dev.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/
    username=fred
    password=test
    oauth2_client_id=1234567890zxcvbasdfgqwert

If your username or password is not specified in your .osmtoolsrc file, these scripts will look for OSMTOOLS_USERNAME and OSMTOOLS_PASSWORD environment variables. As a last resort, you will be prompted for a user name or password on the command line (requires the Term::ReadKey module).

By default, all tools will run in "dry run" mode, so no changes will be actually written and all write requests will be considered successful. Add the "dryrun=0" parameter to the file for live action.

By default, "dry run" also enables "debug" so you are shown the requests made. If you want to keep debug mode when setting dryrun=0, explicitly set debug=1. There's also debug_request_headers and debug_request_body to print out details about the HTML messages, and the same for responses.

Register osmtools as a oauth2 app
---------------------------------

1. Go to the `oauth2/applications/new` page of your *openstreetmap-website* server ([Example](https://api06.dev.openstreetmap.org/oauth2/applications/new)).
2. For Name enter `osmtools` or anything else to identify the application. This name will be shown to users when they grant permissions to *osmtools*.
3. For *Redirect URIs* enter:
    ```
    urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob
    ```
4. Uncheck *Confidential application*
5. In *Permissions* check:
    - *Read user preferences*
    - *Modify the map*
    - *Modify notes*
6. Click *Register*.
7. Add `oauth2_client_id=...` with the application *Client ID* to your `.osmtoolsrc` file.

You don't need to register *osmtools* on `api06.dev.openstreetmap.org` and `api.openstreetmap.org` servers. The scripts have app ids built in for these servers. You can set `oauth2_client_id` to an empty value to refuse to use oauth2 on these servers and go back to basic login/password authorization.

SCRAPE SCRAPE SCRAPE
--------------------

Not everything these scripts do is actually exposed in proper API calls; for the creation of redactions and blocks, the scripts have to resort to actually "playing browser" and going through OSM's login page, set up a session, and then submit the right forms. Needless to say, these hacks are more likely to break than proper API access.
